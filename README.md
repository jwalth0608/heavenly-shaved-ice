Heavenly Shaved Ice

You own and opperate an automated shaved ice stand. A customer will walk up to the stand and make one or more selections, these selections will be displayed in a panel on your app. The icon for a selected flavor will be your logo with a background color which represents the selected shaved ice flavor.

Unfortunately the app to run your shaved ice stand is incomplete.

Make a fork of this repository and complete the following goals:

## GOALS:
 * When a user clicks on a shaved ice option, add the selection to the rendered purchases
 * A purchased flavor's background color should be a combination of the colors in that flavor's recipe
 * Refactor purchased items into their own component
 *  * display the item with its color, name, and ingredients
